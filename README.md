z 🎶 Mood Music Web App

An **interactive and responsive music website** that changes its **background video, theme, and song recommendations** based on the user's selected mood — such as **Happy, Sad, Party, Chill, or Focus**.

🌈 This project demonstrates my front-end skills using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, focusing on dynamic DOM manipulation and UI/UX design.

## 🧠 Features

✨ **Mood Detection:**  
Choose from moods like Happy, Sad, Party, Chill, and Focus — each changes the entire background video and color theme dynamically.

The background seamlessly updates to match your mood — giving you a personalized visual experience.

🎧 **Music Recommendations:**  
Each mood brings a curated YouTube music embed (or playlist) suited to the vibe.

💻 **Fully Responsive Design:**  
Built using HTML5 and CSS3, optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.

🎨 **Custom UI & Animation:**  
Smooth transitions and hover effects for an interactive user experience.
